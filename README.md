# Steps:

1. Create two folders "simulation_output" and "validation_dataset", and place model simulation output to folder "simulation_output", and the validation dataset into "validation_dataset".

2. Run the script 'run_script.R' to generate comparison plot. The script will create a folder "output" and store relevant figures in the folder.
