# EucFACE Multi-model Intercomparison Project Model Simulation Evaluation

to be added


# Steps:

1. Open the R Markdown file "Validation_EucFACE_MIP_Markdown.Rmd".

2. Modify the 'mod.abb' variable to the appropriate model name.

3. Create two folders "simulation_output" and "validation_dataset", and place model simulation output to folder "simulation_output", and the validation dataset into "validation_dataset".

4. You should be able to run the markdown file and generate a pdf named "Validation_EucFACE_MIP_Markdown.pdf", which contains the entire validation figures/texts.
