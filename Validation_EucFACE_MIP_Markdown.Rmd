## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document to compare simulation results against validation dataset for the new EucFACE multi-model intercomparison project (MIP). 

To use this Markdown, please create two folders within this repository and place the relevant data files into each folder. 

- Create a folder "simulation_output", and place the model simulation results into this folder (note, only ambient treatment over the period of 2012 - 2019).

- Create a folder "validation_dataset", and place the validation datasets into this folder (data can be obtained via the CloudStor link sent previously).


This script will firstly check time-averaged (or time-invariant) parameters, flux and stock values, and then check the time-series data. 



## Checking parameters

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
