## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document to compare simulation results against validation dataset for the new EucFACE multi-model intercomparison project (MIP). 

To use this Markdown, please create two folders within this repository and place the relevant data files into each folder. 

- Create a folder "simulation_output", and place the model simulation results into this folder (note, only ambient treatment over the period of 2012 - 2019).

- Create a folder "validation_dataset", and place the validation datasets into this folder (data can be obtained via the CloudStor link sent previously).


This script will firstly check time-averaged (or time-invariant) parameters, flux and stock values, and then check the time-series data. 


#### Variables checked in this script:
The following variables are checked in this script (time scale stated in brackets)

    - Canopy vegetation aboveground C pool
    - Canopy vegetation total C pool
    - 

    - Soil P concentration and pool
    - Microbial P concentration and pool
    - Mycorrhizal P concentration and pool
    - Canopy P concentration, production and pool
    - Wood P concentration, production and pool
    - Fineroot P concentration, production and pool
    - Coarse root P concentration, production and pool
    - Litterfall P concentration and production
    - P mineralization rate
    - Frass P concentration and production
    - Understorey P concentration, production and pool
    - Standing P stock
    - Plant P requirement
    - Total P retranslocation 
    - Leaf P retranslocation coefficient
    - Plant P uptake rate
    
    


## Checking parameters

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}




```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
